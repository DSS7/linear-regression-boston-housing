Linear Regression on Boston House Pricing

Overview:
This project implements a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston using the Boston Housing dataset from the Carnegie Mellon University website. The goal is to explore factors influencing house prices and evaluate model performance.

Dataset:
The Boston Housing dataset includes features such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, and more, with the target variable being the median value of homes.

Key Steps:
Data Loading: Load and preprocess the dataset.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
